            <p>
                The Forest of Hope is the second playable area in Pikmin. On the area 
                select map, it is the center of the vast forest in the game, and has 
                eight ship parts scattered all over the area. Yellow Pikmin are first 
                found in this area. This level would later become the Awakening Wood 
                in Pikmin 2.

            <h2>Bosses/Mini-Bosses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><u>Armored Cannon Beetle</u> - </strong>Part held: <i>Radiation Canopy</i></li>
                <p>
                    “This creature spits out massive rocks and boasts an impenetrable 
                    shell that repels all Pikmin attacks. Just before spitting out a 
                    boulder, it sucks in large breaths of air... Perhaps its air hole 
                    will provide a clue to it's weakness.” - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Burrowing Snagret</u> - </strong>Part held: <i>Geiger Counter</i></li>
                <p>
                    “The majority of snagret species lie in wait to ambush and 
                    capture prey, with a body type perfectly adapted to such sudden 
                    strikes. It violently attacks small, surface-dwelling insects. 
                    Distributed across a relatively wide range, subspecies of snagret 
                    suited to the varying soil conditions have emerged, making the 
                    snagret the most geographically represented species besides the 
                    bulborb. Visually resembling the burrowing snagret is the 
                    burrowing snarrow, the range of which partially overlaps with the 
                    snagret's range. While the two may appear similar, when pulled 
                    from the ground they can be distinguished by the presence or 
                    absence of tail and wing markings.” - Captain Olimar

            <h2>Parts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><u>Eternal Fuel Dynamo</u> - </strong> min: 40 any color Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "Why, it's the Eternal Fuel Dynamo! It has an unlimited
                    energy supply! I won't have to worry about saving
                    electricity anymore! This will make my fight for
                    survival a bit easier..." - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Whimsical Radio</u> -</strong> min: 20 any color Pikmin</li>
                <p>
                    "It's my Whimsical Radar! With this, I'll be able to see all
                    nearby ship parts in a single glance—I just press Y to check
                    it. This find fills me with great hope." - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Extraordinary Bolt</u> -</strong> min: 30 any color Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "It's the Extraordinary Bolt! I bought this incredible bolt
                    because the salesman told me it is of extraordinary quality
                    that is indiscernible to the average person. Exactly what
                    makes it so extraordinary is a secret. But just look at it!
                    Extraordinary!" - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Nova Blaster</u> -</strong> min: 30 any color Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "I've found the Nova Blaster! This emits a dazzling burst of
                    light capable of destroying almost anything! I'm not exactly
                    sure about this, but the promotional brochure claims that its
                    blasts can travel in the currents of space-time, smashing
                    through stars and into the rifts of space." - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Shock Absorber</u> -</strong> min: 30 any color Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "It's the Shock Absorber! This apparatus counteracts the
                    shaking and swaying that normally occurs during flight. It's
                    smooth sailing with this in place... Usually." - Captain
                    Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Radiation Canopy</u> -</strong> min: 30 any color Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "At last! My Radiation Canopy! This turns the harsh radiation
                    of deep space into soft, infrared rays that are easy on the
                    body. I'll sleep like a baby once I get this back to the
                    ship!" - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Geiger Counter</u> -</strong> min: 15 blue Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "It's the Geiger Counter! Every spaceship needs one of these,
                    but I don't actually know what it's for. Every once in a
                    while, it goes wild and lets out a lot of noise, but I never
                    pay much attention to it, so it doesn't do me much good. I
                    really should read that instruction manual one of these days!"
                    - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Sagittarius</u> -</strong> min: 20 blue Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "I've found my Sagittarius! My son gave this to me as a
                    present. It brings to mind vision of my son back home on
                    Planet Hocotate. Oh, to be back there right now!" - Captain
