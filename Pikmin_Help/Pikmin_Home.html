                Pikmin is the first game in the series, released in 2001. The game's plot focuses on 
                Captain Olimar's predicament of having crash-landed on an unknown planet and befriending 
                plant-animal creatures that he dubs as Pikmin. Olimar has to gather the missing pieces 
                of his broken spaceship in order to escape, before his air supply completely runs out 
                and he succumbs to the planet's oxygen-rich atmosphere, which is poisonous to his 
                species.

                Pikmin features three endings, which are dependent on the number of spaceship parts 
                reclaimed. Reclaiming all thirty parts by the final day results in the best ending: 
                Olimar waves goodbye to the Pikmin, who proceed to defend themselves on their own at 
                nighttime, while Onions of various colors observe his departure off as he looks back on 
                the unknown planet before returning home. Reclaiming at least the twenty-five required 
                parts by the final day results in the normal ending: Olimar quickly departs, while one 
                of each type of Pikmin run toward his ship to watch him depart. Lastly, failing to 
                reclaim the twenty-five required parts by the final day results in the worst ending: 
                Olimar crash-lands back onto the planet, succumbs to oxygen poisoning, and is taken by a 
                number of Pikmin to be placed into an Onion, which converts him into a Pikmin-Hocotatian 
                hybrid.

                This website will show you where, on the in-game map, each part is, what area they are 
                in and what bosses and mini bosses lie ahead. A Pikmin counter showing how many of what 
                color is needed for each part is also shown next to the name. Quotes from Olimar in-game 
                are given for each boss/mini-boss and part shown
