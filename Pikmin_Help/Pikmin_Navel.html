            <p>
                The Forest Navel is the third area in the first Pikmin game. 
                The entire area is underground and is accessed by a hole in a 
                vast clearing of the forest. According to Captain Olimar, from 
                high altitude it looks like a belly button, hence its name. 
                One of the distinguishing features of this cave is the 
                neighboring lakes of water at different altitudes, which are 
                based on the real world structures called rimstone dams. This 
                area is where Olimar meets Blue Pikmin for the first time. 
                Nine pieces of his ship, the Dolphin, can be found in the area, 
                as well as many new enemies. It is the only Pikmin area not to 
                be remade in Pikmin 2, but remade in Pikmin 3 as downloadable 
                content – it is known as Forgotten Cove.

            <h2>Bosses/Mini-Bosses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><u>Breadbug</u> - </strong>Part held: <i>Space Float</i></li>
                <p>
                    “This pesky scavenger is truly annoying. It attempts to steal the 
                    spoils that the Pikmin earn in battle. If the Pikmin chase it too 
                    far, they can be dragged into its lair along with their food. It 
                    may look weak, but its appearance is deceiving.” - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Puffstool</u> - </strong>Part held: <i>Omega Stabilizer</i></li>
                <p>
                    “This creature's cap is elastic, negating any Pikmin attacks. 
                    Attacking its lower torso works better, but the puffstool lets 
                    out spores that turn the Pikmin into mushrooms, which then attack 
                    me! They return to normal when shaken off.” - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Beady Long Legs</u> - </strong>Part held: <i>Guard Satellite</i></li>
                <p>
                    “This creature is so large, it would tower over the Dolphin. All 
                    the Pikmin can do is cling to its feet and try to slow it down. 
                    Its large round torso is its sole weak point - since Yellow 
                    Pikmin fly highest, they should be most effective against it.” - 
                    Captain Olimar
                </p>
            </ul>

            <h2>Parts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><u>#1 Ionium Jet</u> -</strong> min: 15 blue Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "I've found my #1 Ionium Jet! Unfortunately, this puts out a
                    slightly odoriferous exhaust, but it does propel me to escape
                    velocity in an instant. The stench is a small price to pay for
                    such performance!" - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Gravity Jumper</u> -</strong> min: 25 blue Pikmin</li>
                <p>
                    "I've found my Gravity Jumper! By manipulating the forces of
                    gravity, this key component gives me the final boost I need
                    to make the jump to super light speed. Good thing I found it."
                    - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Automatic Gear</u> -</strong> min: 15 any color Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "I've found the Automatic Gear! This thing chugs right along
                    at its own pace. It makes piloting much easier, giving me
                    time to concentrate on the finer points of space travel."
                    - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Space Float</u> -</strong> min: 30 any color Pikmin</li>
                <p>
                    "This float is an absolute necessity for any pilot who lacks
                    skill at swimming in space. An excellent swimmer like me has
                    no need for something like this, but my motto is 'always be
                    prepared.' Really, it's just for emergencies." - Captain
                    Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Anti-Dioxin Filter</u> -</strong> min: 40 blue Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "It's the Anti-Dioxin Filter! This fits over the rocket's
                    exhaust port and filters out all disease-causing agents from
                    the ship's exhaust. That means I'll be able to move around
                    without polluting the planet's atmosphere! I feel worlds
                    better!" - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Libra</u> -</strong> min: 15 red Pikmin</li>
                <p>
                    "I've found my Libra! My daughter gave this to me. It's named
                    after her astrological sign. My sweet little girl... I wonder
                    what she's doing right at this moment..." - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Analog Computer</u> -</strong> min: 20 red Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "I've found my Analog Computer! This computer conveys the
                    kind of vague data that falls outside the range of ones and
                    zeros. Actually, to be honest, it's a little bit too vague,
                    so it isn't very helpful." - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Omega Stabilizer</u> -</strong> min: 30 red Pikmin</li>
                <p>
                    "I've found the Omega Stabilizer! I absolutely must have this
                    piece if my battered ship is ever to fly straight again. It
                    has steered me through countless deep space storms. That, and
                    it looks rather cool." - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Guard Satellite</u> -</strong> min: 20 red Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "The Guard Satellite! Deep space is filled with dangers. This
                    automated satellite does its part to help guard both me and
                    my spaceship. I'll sleep better at night once this little
                    satellite is back on duty." - Captain Olimar
