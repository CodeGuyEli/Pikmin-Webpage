            <p>
                The Distant Spring is the fourth area Olimar discovers on his first 
                visit to the Pikmin Planet. It is part of a huge wetland at the edge 
                of the forest, which is why it was named "The Distant Spring". The 
                terrain is mostly aquatic with unique creatures spread throughout. 
                This land also is home to a plurality of Captain Olimar's missing 
                ship parts, of which there are ten. The Perplexing Pool bears 
                resemblance to The Distant Spring. They feature similar maps and 
                similar looking ledges, and the same tree trunks.

            <h2>Bosses/Mini-Bosses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><u>Puffy Blowhog</u> - </strong>Part held: <i>Interstellar Radio</i></li>
                <p>
                    “This is a large-bodied, flying organism, but it is possible that 
                    its interior is as empty as a blimp. If I can land a large number 
                    of Pikmin on it, they may be able to ground it. And then, once 
                    it's down, it will feel my sprouts' rage!” - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Armored Cannon Beetle</u> - </strong>Part held: <i>Bowspit</i></li>
                <p>
                    “This creature spits out massive rocks and boasts an impenetrable 
                    shell that repels all Pikmin attacks. Just before spitting out a 
                    boulder, it sucks in large breaths of air... Perhaps its air hole 
                    will provide a clue to it's weakness.” - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Smoky Progg</u> - </strong>Part held: <i>None</i></li>
                <p>
                    “This hideous beast comes from a strange, hard egg. Its 
                    mollusk-like body is wrapped in an unpleasant gas that suffocates 
                    any Pikmin that inhales it. Attacking its head is successful, but 
                    it's best to eliminate in egg form.” - Captain Olimar
                </p>
            </ul>

            <h2>Parts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><u>Repair-Type Bolt</u> -</strong> min: 20 yellow Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "I've found the Repair-type Bolt! This robotic marvel can fix
                    just about anything in the ship that's broken. That's good,
                    because I get terribly bored fixing little glitches." -
                    Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Message Machine</u> -</strong> min: 30 blue Pikmin</li>
                <p>
                    "I've found my Massage Machine! Put this right down in the
                    lower back area and let it go to work. I can't wait until I
                    get this installed again, as my lower lumbar region has been
                    paining me ever since the crash. Ahh, sweet relief..." -
                    Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Intersteller Radio</u> -</strong> min: 20 blue Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "I've found my Interstellar Radio! Not only does it emit a
                    constant S.O.S. signal, it also broadcasts voices from space
                    that will brighten up my moments of boredom. The Dolphin,
                    while comfortable, becomes quite a lonely place in the depths
                    of the night..." - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Gluon Drive</u> -</strong> min: 50 blue Pikmin</li>
                <p>
                    "I've found the Gluon Drive! Using the quark-binding
                    metaphysical properties of gluons, this device... Well, it's...
                    very scientific, and I don't fully understand it myself, but
                    it was very expensive..." - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>UV Lamp</u> -</strong> min: 10 yellow Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "I've found my UV Lamp! The only problem with this handheld
                    light is that it can be too bright at times. I have to
                    remember to wear my sun visor whenever I look into it." -
                    Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Zirconium Rotor</u> -</strong> min: 30 blue Pikmin</li>
                <p>
                    "It's my Zirconium Rotor! This is made from rust-proof
                    zirconium, which is particularly suited to making spaceship
                    parts. I had to pay a lot extra to have this installed, and
                    I suspect the mechanic overcharged me." - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Pilot's Seat</u> -</strong> min: 25 any color Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "At last! My Pilot's Seat! Once I get this installed, my
                    cockpit will finally be back in order. Soon, my ship will be
                    starting to look more and more like the Dolphin of old. Ah,
                    the memories..." - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Bowsprit</u> -</strong> min: 30 red Pikmin</li>
                <p>
                    "I've discovered the Bowsprit! With this piece installed, my
                    ship should regain some of its sleek shape." - Captain
                    Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Chronos Reactor</u> -</strong> min: 20 blue Pikmin </li>
                <p>
                    "I've found my Chronos Reactor! Using strange new technology,
                    this machine is able to warp the space-time continuum and
                    turn it into energy. I am constantly amazed at how many
                    mysteries are locked inside the parts of my ship..." - Captain
                    Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>#2 Ionium Jet</u> -</strong> min: 15 blue Pikmin</li>
                <p>
                    "I've found my #2 Ionium Jet! It's easy on the eyes, and its
                    fuel efficiency is easy on the budget." - Captain Olimar
