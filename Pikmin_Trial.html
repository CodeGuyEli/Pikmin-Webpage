                The Final Trial is the last area to be accessed in Pikmin. In the 
                area selection menu, it is across a small body of water from the 
                other areas, and has radically different terrain. It only has one 
                part and is almost enemy-free, save the Emperor Bulblax, which holds 
                the last ship part, the Secret Safe. It should be noted that this 
                area, in a way, tests the player's knowledge on the Pikmin. From the 
                landing site, the area "splits" into three paths. The left path 
                focuses on Red Pikmin, due to the fire geysers. The center path 
                contains water which only Blue Pikmin can traverse through. The 
                path on the right contains bomb-rocks, which only Yellow Pikmin can 
                hold.

                <p>
                    “The largest member of the grub-dog family is normally found 
                    buried in the ground, with only the stalks of its eyes exposed. 
                    This camouflage allows the predator to surprise smaller creatures 
                    and use its long, adhesive tongue to capture prey. The thick hide 
                    and angular hump give the organism a distinct rocklike quality. 
                    During the rainy season, moss grows freely on its hump, making it 
                    nearly impossible to distinguish this lethal predator from a 
                    stone.” - Captain Olimar

                    "At long last... I've found the final part...my Secret Safe!
                    And it's as full as ever! How glad I am that I've persisted
                    in my search without losing hope... Now I can leave this
                    planet without any regrets. Maybe I'll even stop and pick up
                    some souvenirs for my wife and kids back on Planet Hocotate!"
