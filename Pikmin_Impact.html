            <p>
                The Impact Site is where Captain Olimar first lands after 
                his ship crashes on PNF-404 in Pikmin, and so the first day 
                is spent there. The area is near the edge of the vast forest 
                on the area select map, not far from The Forest of Hope. 
                The Impact Site is the location of the discovery of the Red 
                Onion with its associated Red Pikmin. This area and The Final 
                Trial make up the Wistful Wild in Pikmin 2. Because of its 
                size and few ship parts, this area is one of the least 
                visited in a regular playthrough, but is also the best one to 
                increase Pikmin population in.

            <h2>Bosses/Mini-Bosses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><u>Goolix</u> - </strong>Part held: <i>None</i></li>
                <p>
                    “Within the transparent gel that envelops this organism are two 
                    nuclei that appear to make up its actual torso - and most likely 
                    its entire nerve center. The nuclei look like they're hard, but I 
                    believe that there must be some way to crack them.” - Captain 
                    Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Mamuta</u> - </strong>Part held: <i>None</i></li>
                <p>
                    “A mamuta cannot defeat a Pikmin, but it can pound the trooper 
                    into the ground with its heavy arms. In fact, one rock beast can 
                    bury several Pikmin with a single blow. After you defeat the 
                    Mamuta with flying attacks, be sure to pluck your buddies from 
                    the soil-their tops will be in full bloom.” - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Amazing! There's no mistaking it! My ship's engine
                    rests before my very eyes! By a stroke of pure luck,
                    I have already stumbled upon the most important piece of
                    my damaged craft! Fate has smiled upon me! But... How
                    will I get it back to the Dolphin?" - Captain Olimar
                </p>

                <li><strong><u>Positron Generator</u> -</strong> min: 20 blue Pikmin</li>
                <p>
                    "I've found the Positron Generator! By combining its
                    batteries with solar cells, this machine can generate
                    incredible amounts of electricity. What a timely find!
                    Those Instant Space Noodles will taste better when heated
                    up" - Captain Olimar
